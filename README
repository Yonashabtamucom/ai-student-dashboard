# AI-Powered Student Performance Monitoring System

An end-to-end machine learning dashboard that identifies **at-risk students**, explains *why* they are at risk using explainable AI (SHAP), analyzes student feedback sentiment, and provides actionable academic recommendations — all through an interactive **Streamlit** interface.

# Machine Learning Models

# Classification
- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Target:** At-Risk Students (Low Performance)
- **Why Random Forest?**
  - Handles non-linear relationships
  - Robust to noisy features
  - Works well on structured educational data
  - Compatible with SHAP for interpretability

# Regression
- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Target:** Engagement-based performance score (synthetic)

# Explainable AI (Why SHAP?)

Educational predictions impact real students.  
SHAP provides **transparent, per-student explanations**, ensuring:
- Trust in predictions
- Ethical decision support
- Interpretability for educators

 This system is designed as a **decision-support tool**, not an automated decision-maker.
